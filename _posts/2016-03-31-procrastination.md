I love procastinating. It's addictive to give in to the little
distractions. Why am I even writing words when I could be checking
reddit? 

For me, the point of trying to put my thoughts down is a matter of
discipline. Often, the opposite of procrastinating is sprinting towards
some productive end. This tends to be stressful and inefficient.

It's my hope that by spending time intro/retrospecting regularly, I can
be more present. These posts will be like little directed meditations.
