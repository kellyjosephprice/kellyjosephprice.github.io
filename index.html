            <span class="bold greeting">I'm an unemployed software engineer</span> 
            living in San Jose, CA. Don't worry, I quit to learn new things. 
            <span class="bold zoba">I have a cat, Zoba,</span> 
            and recently discovered bicycle touring. So far 
            <span class="bold big-sur">I've only done weekend tours,</span>
            but I plan on biking from Eureka back to the Bay later this year. And
            hopefully around this time next year, I want to bike across the
            States.
        </p>
        <p>
            I grew up in the East Bay and have lived in the South Bay for the last
            ten years. While working as a barista and then coffee roaster, I tried
            going to various community colleges. Through trial and error, I got
            into CS classes and was offered an internship. Shortly after, I dropped 
            out and started working as an engineer fulltime.
