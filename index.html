            I'm an unemployed software engineer living in San Jose, CA. Don't
            worry, I quit to learn new things. I have a cat, Zoba, and recently
            discovered bicycling touring. So far I've only done weekend tours, but
            I plan on biking from Eureka back to the Bay later this year. And
            hopefully around this time next year, I want to bike across the
            States.
        </p>
        <p>
            I grew up in the East Bay and have lived in the South Bay for the last
            ten years. While working as a barista and coffee roaster, I tried
            going to various community colleges. Through trial and error, I got
            into CS classes and was offered an internship. Shortly after, I dropped 
            out and started working fulltime.
