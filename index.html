    <h1>Kelly Joseph Price</h1>
    <p>
        I'm an unemployed software engineer living in San Jose, CA. Don't
        worry, I quit to learn new things. I have a cat, Zoba, and recently
        discovered bicycling touring. So far I've only done weekend tours, but
        I plan on biking from Eureka back to the Bay later this year. And
        hopefully around this time next year, I want to bike across the
        States.

        I grew up in the East Bay and have lived in the South Bay for the last
        ten years. While working as a barista and coffee roaster, I tried
        going to various community colleges. Through trial and error, I got
        into CS classes and was offered an internship. Shortly after, I dropped 
        out and started working fulltime.
